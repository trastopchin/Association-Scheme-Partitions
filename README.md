# Association-Scheme-Partitions

This project uses GAP to compute equitable partitions of association schemes. This project uses and extends Izumi Miyamoto and Akihide Hanaki's code that already answers questions about association schemes to help compute equitable partitions. Created as a final research project for our Algebraic Graph Theory course at Grinnell College the spring of 2020 with professor Christopher French.

This project is comprised of the code that we wrote and the paper we wrote about the project. All of the code that we wrote is in the [equitable_partitions.gap](https://github.com/trastopchin/Association-Scheme-Partitions/blob/master/equitable_partitions.gap) file, where we wrote helper methods and algorithms to compute and log equitable partitions of association schemes. The [paper](insert link) we wrote gives some mathematical background on association schemes and equitable partitions, details our programming conventions, documents our methods, and explains our algorithms.
